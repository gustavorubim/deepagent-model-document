# Fictitious Regression Model Project

This example project simulates a credit-loss regression model used for documentation testing.

## Workflow

1. `generate_data.py` creates synthetic tabular data.
2. `train.py` fits a linear model and stores learned coefficients.
3. `evaluate.py` calculates MAE, RMSE, and R2 and writes metrics.

## Notes

- Data is synthetic and for testing only.
- Model is intentionally simple to keep the repository lightweight.
